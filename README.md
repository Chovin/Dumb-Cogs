PICO-8 is a fantasy console (an emulator for a console that doesn't exist). It's a [delightful tool](https://youtu.be/K5RXMuH54iw) for making games and prototypes.

You can get PICO-8 yourself [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) or 
play around with the education version [in your browser](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/) (but you can't copy/paste sprites directly from the education version)

## Credits

* The wonderful [PICO-8 software](https://pico8.com/) is made by Joseph White (zep)
* I think one of the code_cleanup function in the PICO-8 cog is comes from a derivitive of the repl command from [RoboDanny](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny/blob/rewrite/cogs/admin.py#L97-L104).
